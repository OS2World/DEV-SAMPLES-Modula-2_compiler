This Modula-2 package is an early beta-release
(Version 2.01) for 32-bit OS/2 2.x or 3.0.
But I have already developed many applications
using this compiler. Please send any bug reports
or comments only to my e-mail address:

  CompuServe:       76721,303

Please notice the licence agreements in the
text file "LICEN-US.TXT" or "LICEN-GR.TXT".


To install the package, simply call
"SETUP-US.CMD" or "SETUP-GR.CMD"
from an OS/2 command prompt and follow the
displayed instructions.

And now, happy Modula-programming!
